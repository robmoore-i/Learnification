# Learnification

## Technical priorities

### Major

- Nail down android internal storage behaviour in integration tests

- Injectable components for use in Android tests

### Minor

- UI test coverage across the most important journeys.

- Unit test coverage

## MVP

- I can download the app from the play store

- I can define my own learning items and browse them

- I periodically get notifications based on my learning items, at a periodicity I define

- I can pay as little for the app as I want to

## Plan

1. Deliver the MVP to the PlayStore.

2. Iterate

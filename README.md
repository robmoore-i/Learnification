# Learnification

## Technical priorities

### Major

- Change persistence to SQLite, using RxJava for access

- Managing the application entry points across different activities

### Minor

- Meaningful unit tests

- Injectable components for use in integration tests

- Use empty-list UX pattern for creating learning items, rather than having default ones.

## MVP

- I can define my own learning items

- I can choose which learning items are members of the current periodic ballot

- I periodically get notifications based on my active learning items

- I can download it from the play store

- I can donate to Rob if I want to

## Plan

1. Deliver the MVP to the PlayStore.

2. Iterate

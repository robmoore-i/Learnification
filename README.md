# Learnification

## Non-functional priorities

### Major

- Integration tests for storage layer (AndroidInternalStorageAdaptor)

- Analytics for user behaviour

- Use empty-list UX pattern for creating learning items, rather than having default ones.

- UI test coverage across the most important journeys.

### Minor

- Injectable components for use in Android tests

- Unit test coverage

## MVP

- I can download the app from the play store

- I can define my own learning items and browse them

- I periodically get notifications based on my learning items, at a periodicity I define

- I can pay as little for the app as I want to

## Plan

1. Deliver the MVP to the PlayStore.

2. Iterate

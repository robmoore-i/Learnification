# Learnification

## Technical priorities

- Integration tests

- Managing the application entry points across different activities

## MVP

- I can define my own learning items

- I can choose which learning items are members of the current periodic ballot

- I periodically get notifications based on my active learning items

- I can switch it off if it's on, and switch it on if it's off

- I can download it from the play store

- I can donate to Rob if I want to

## Plan

1. Deliver the MVP

2. Iterate
